Title: The bioprotocal for recovering pseudo-dynamic networks from static data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Chixiang Chen
Maintainer: Chixiang Chen <chencxxy@hotmail.com>
Description: We developed a statistical pipeline called DRDNet to visualize and trace how genes dynamically interact with each other across diverse tissues to shape health risk from static expression data. DRDNet coding all genes into bidirectional, signed, weighted, and feedback looped networks will provide profound genomic information for medical doctors to design precise medicine.
